    <p>A simple recipe to make a pizza and it's sauce from scratch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2-3/4 to 3-1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage, cooked and drained</li>
            <li>1 can (4 ounces) mushroom stems and pieces, drained</li>
            <li>1 medium green pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1-1/2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the oil, salt, sugar and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rest in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients; set aside. Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to greased 12-in. pizza pans; build up edges slightly. Prick dough thoroughly with a fork.</li>
            <li>Bake until lightly browned, 12-15 minutes. Spread sauce over hot crusts to within 2-in. of edges; top with sausage, mushrooms, green pepper and cheese. Bake 20 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.</li>
        </ol>

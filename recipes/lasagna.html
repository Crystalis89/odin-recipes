    <p>A recipe for a spin of a classic lasagna made with smoked gouda and lemon zest added.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil, for coating baking dish</li>
        <li>9 to 12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 fresh lemon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>24 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>16 ounces grated smoked gouda cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. Lightly coat a 2-quart baking dish with olive oil and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles until al dente according to package instructions. Rinse under cold water until cool. Lay the cooked pasta flat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon zest, salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread a light layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Lay 3 to 4 lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Layer one-third of the remaining tomato sauce over the lasagna noodles. Layer half of the ricotta cheese over the sauce and then spread one-third of the smoked gouda cheese. Repeat this pattern: noodles, sauce, ricotta cheese and smoked gouda cheese. Add a final layer of lasagna noodles following by the remaining tomato sauce and remaining smoked gouda.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagna for about 45 minutes or until the top cheese is melted and golden.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven; let cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
